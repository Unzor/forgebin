ForgeBin - an automation tool for building and releasing projects.
# Progress
Nearly finished, major fixing needed for exporting
# Description
## ForgeBin
A tool for releasing your app however and whenever you want, automatically.
## What is ForgeBin actually for?
ForgeBin is a tool for automatically building tools and creating releases on GitHub. When it is time, it will run the requested commands to build the tool then export the files to a release.
## How do I use my own project for building?
ForgeBin is not completed yet, but when it is completed (soon), you will have to:
- Create a repository and an empty release
- Make a file named "Forgefile" in the repo and list the build commands and files to export
- Visit the site
- Click the "Set Up" button
- Input your Auth token for GitHub
- Input the repository
